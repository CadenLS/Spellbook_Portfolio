            <p>Lex Talionis A, the law of retaliation, whereby a punishment resembles the offense committed. 
              As Aliens you must fight your way through astronauts, drones and bosses in order to enact your revenge on the humans for their hostile takeover. 
              Every alien life is sacred, and in this team based couch co-op experience you will have to place your trust in your companions to not use all your lives. 
              There are four aliens to choose from with abilities ranging from a golf club to summoning a mammoth. 
              But no matter who you choose you mustn't give up on your assault..THIS..IS..WAR!</p>

            <h2>Physics Game</h2>
            <img src="images/project3.png" alt="Project 3 screenshot" />
            <p>
              This Physics Game allows users to place balls with different masses and interact with a variety of physics parameters. You can adjust sliders for gravity, time step (which controls the simulation's update frequency and accuracy), and more. It's a sandbox for exploring how physics works in a game environment. As someone who enjoys physics, I created/added onto this project to deepen my understanding and to share that curiosity with others.

            <h2>Echolon (Personal Project)</h2>
            <p>
              Echolon is a personal project I'm developing that combines elements of soulslike and gacha games—two genres I really enjoy. The game will feature challenging, soulslike combat alongside a gacha system for collecting unique characters, weapons, and abilities. Each character will have their own playstyle and abilities, offering lots of variety and replayability. I'm excited to bring together deep combat and the thrill of collection in one experience.
